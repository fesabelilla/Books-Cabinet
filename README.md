# Project Title: Books Cabinet

# Introduction:
Books are part of a student’s life. Grade-1 to PhD researchers need books as study materials. After the usage or passing the levels, grades, semester some books become unnecessary. Some books are stored in the store room or our books cabinet. After being untouched for a long day those books become dusty. Some books are damaged for some reason. Like bookworms (beetles, moths and cockroaches) which may bore or chew through books seeking food, are responsible. If we share the books with other students who are currently seeking the exact books in exchange of money or books. So, users can post of his/her old books with images, book condition, address and some other details. One of the motto of the project is " Sharing old books and filling up your wallet ".
Except for the old books, users can purchase new books directly from publishers all the time, like ‘Ekushey Book Fair‘. Users can also purchase the books from store sellers without bargaining about price. They can choose the lowest price books offered from sellers. The buyer can search the book using the book name and get the book details. Our project is to make a platform to connect the buyer and seller. People will be beneficial and buyers can purchase the books at a fair price. As well as, the book market will be more competitive.
